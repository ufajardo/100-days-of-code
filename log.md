# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Introduction**: Before I started the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, I had started a Python Django project centered around building my own personal blog/website. This project will not only allow me to reteach any interesting concepts, but give me first hand experience with the Django framework.

### Day 0: April 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to make the Category Model and an addition to the "Post" Model in the Django practiceProject I have. The Post Model uses a ManytoManyField that allows multiple Categories to one post. There was also designs to the HTML/CSS for the blog details page -- looks pretty nice.

**Thoughts:** As I progress with Django, I'm going to be needing more resources on how to approach the best practices for this framework. Hopefully, I'll be able to learn more about deployment and have it live.

**Link to work:** Not yet... :c

### Day 1: April 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Created an additional model "EmailList" that will allow users to submit a form consisting of their name and email to be added to a "subscription list". There was also some work done on being able to filter blog posts by category.

**Thoughts:** Thank goodness for StackOverflow. I wouldn't have been able to make it through all the errors without them. Also, to better my challenge, I think maybe spending more time on OTHER people's projects would also prove pretty great, as well as submitting my own work.

**Link to work:** Not yet... :c

### Day 2: April 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
>>Worked on the personal website some more - More CSS, making the blog and category pages look a lot more decent. This includes just general format and design of the tags. Made some corrections to the URLs and what pages take you where.

>>Tested myself with what I've learned about 2 months ago -- created a new project and got a regular HTML page to display. 

**Thoughts:** Testing myself took me longer than I thought, mostly because I forgot ONE line of code... declaring the app_name and having a namespace defined in the main URL file. This will serve as the beginning of an ACTUAL raw project -- a url shortener. This is to display my progress and test my abilities of what I've learned from other projects, and work on something that I've never done before. Should be simple... right?

### Day 3: April 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked a lot on the URL Shortener I've been working on in Django. Managed to get a few things done.
	- Created a function that will randomly generate a random set of characters for the new provided URL.
	- Set up the Model and Form on the page.
	- Set up the redirection view that will take in a value (from the url) and spit out the original_link.

Tomorrow I'd like to work on the front end of it as well as possibly get deployment rolling.


**Thoughts:** I feel a little bit insecure about my development skill set. I know there is plenty to learn and I believe I'm heading in the right direction. However, I feel that I need to rely heavily on resources such as the django documentation, or notes from my Python class. It's things that are simple but they aren't memorized material. I feel like this is both a weakness and a strength. I have resources and should be able to utilize them, no?

### Day 4: April 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

URL Shortener Part 2:

- Made CSS for page. It looks pretty basic, but I don't typically challenge myself to draw up RAW CSS. I'm a big fan of Bootstrap. 

- I made a change to the gen_link function. I don't want any collisions w/ URLs.



**Thoughts:** I have intentions of deploying this app live, however, I don't think it's secured just yet.

### Day 5: April 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

- Created a search function and search bar for the blog page. Took me a lot longer to figure out than it should have.

**Thoughts:** I looked for many resources on this, and a lot of it was referring to old documents. I should be able to cover more ground tomorrow.


**Link to work:** Nope :c

### Day 6: April 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working with django authentication on personal project.

**Thoughts:** Seems pretty different from PHP authentication.


**Link to work:** Nope :c


### Day 7, 8, 9: April 17, 18, 19  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Over the last few days, I've spent some time working on basic challenges from a challenge I had saved for rainy days (like, now). The challenges were:

 - Dice Rolling - Create a function that will allow you to roll a die and obtain a random number between 1 and 6 for each prompt.

 - Guess The Number - Similar to the previous challenge, except it has the end-user guess for the number that's been generated. Based on the guess, it notifies the end-user if it's too high or low of a number.

 - Hangman - I didn't get an image affiliated with it, but it's hangman, alright.

 - Mad Libs -  Inspired by Summer Sonâ€™s Mad Libs project with Javascript, it allows me to manipulate user inputted data.



**Thoughts:** These challenges did make me think, but it wasn't SUPER challenging. I'll have to find more deeper challenges!

### Day 10: April 20,  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Spent most of today working on material design improvements to the personal website.

**Thoughts:** I'm really bad at material design.


**Link to work:** None :c


### Day 11: April 21,  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Spent most of today working on material design improvements to the personal website, again, as well as took a shot at the authentication process for a website.

**Thoughts:** I really don't know what the standard is for building an authentication system. I think I'll just have it embedded within an app rather than being it's own..


**Link to work:** None :c


### Day 12: April 22,  2019 

**Today's Progress**:Running towards that midnight mark and I've got most of the "transition" to material design done. This also included consolidating CSS and static files as well as properly setting up a "base.html" extends template page and proper organization of django files.

**Thoughts:** Running into basic problems...


**Link to work:** None :c


### Day 13: April 23,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got it going!! Everything looks good so far. I'll have to dive into sessions and such, then Django Rest Framework, with APIs and such. All the pages have moved over to Material Design and a basic sign in option as well as the option 

**Thoughts:** I'm going to get back onto my linux box and see if I can get that appropriately setup. Then, I'll have my own server up and running on it.


**Link to work:** None :c

### Day 14: April 24,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the personal website, of course. Created a dynamic navigation bar and did some form clean up throughout the website. 

**Thoughts:** It's been 15(?) days since I've started the challenge, and I haven't had much to SHOW for it, yet. I mean, the personal website will definitely be up. but I think I'll start focusing my challenge hours on other people's projects in the mean time!


**Link to work:** None :c

### Day 15: April 25,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on the personal website, but I've decided to work on other projects as I'm working on this. Something that I can present and place on github. Something that I can share with the community. This project start is the content_aggregator intermediate challenge that web scrapes content and consolidates it onto a single page. So far, I've created the initial project and set up models. 

**Thoughts:** Setting it up an entirely new project will solidify my knowledge on building and intializing the beginning portion of websites/git repos. There's a few things I'd like to do for the personal website -- such as applying a twitter API. This will give me some more information on pulling data from a website and using that data.

### Day 16: April 26,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working on getting a background-process running for apscheduler to run functions on an interval of 5 minutes.

**Thoughts:** None at this time.


**Link to work:** https://github.com/ufajardo/content_aggregator


### Day 17: April 29,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: APScheduler is up and running! I've also done some research and studying for BeautifulSoup4 and hopefully will be able to get this on the roll. The reason why it was taking so long for Apscheduler is because since I had made changes and technically have a "customer config" file in one of the apps, I needed to refer to that config file, and not the app name itself. As soon as I got that rolling, it sparked up and started rolling.

**Thoughts:** I might have to explore a more dynamic and responsive website in the future. This will have to do with Django Rest Framework, I believe. It will definitely have to work deeper into server side operations -- right now, I have been working from within the app.

### Day 18: April 30,  2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked and got BeautifulSoup working -- currently set up as a function that is running on an interval being managed in the background with APSecheduler. And of course, made some adjustments to the models because my approach to how the information would be stored changed with how I was obtaining the information. Grabbing information from CNN was successful, such as titles of new articles and hrefs that belong to those articles -- however, Fox and Reuters is returning forbidden when trying to parse their website. :c I can either go around it or just find another website that'll be friendly to my challenge needs.


**Thoughts:** I have explored a bit about APIs - and that's probably where I'll start exploring for pulling additional information to the aggregator.
