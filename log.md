# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Introduction**: Before I started the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, I had started a Python Django project centered around building my own personal blog/website. This project will not only allow me to reteach any interesting concepts, but give me first hand experience with the Django framework.

### Day 0: April 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to make the Category Model and an addition to the "Post" Model in the Django practiceProject I have. The Post Model uses a ManytoManyField that allows multiple Categories to one post. There was also designs to the HTML/CSS for the blog details page -- looks pretty nice.

**Thoughts:** As I progress with Django, I'm going to be needing more resources on how to approach the best practices for this framework. Hopefully, I'll be able to learn more about deployment and have it live.

**Link to work:** Not yet... :c

### Day 1: April 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Created an additional model "EmailList" that will allow users to submit a form consisting of their name and email to be added to a "subscription list". There was also some work done on being able to filter blog posts by category.

**Thoughts:** Thank goodness for StackOverflow. I wouldn't have been able to make it through all the errors without them. Also, to better my challenge, I think maybe spending more time on OTHER people's projects would also prove pretty great, as well as submitting my own work.
