# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Introduction**: Before I started the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, I had started a Python Django project centered around building my own personal blog/website. This project will not only allow me to reteach any interesting concepts, but give me first hand experience with the Django framework.

### Day 0: April 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to make the Category Model and an addition to the "Post" Model in the Django practiceProject I have. The Post Model uses a ManytoManyField that allows multiple Categories to one post. There was also designs to the HTML/CSS for the blog details page -- looks pretty nice.

**Thoughts:** As I progress with Django, I'm going to be needing more resources on how to approach the best practices for this framework. Hopefully, I'll be able to learn more about deployment and have it live.

**Link to work:** Not yet... :c

### Day 1: April 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Created an additional model "EmailList" that will allow users to submit a form consisting of their name and email to be added to a "subscription list". There was also some work done on being able to filter blog posts by category.

**Thoughts:** Thank goodness for StackOverflow. I wouldn't have been able to make it through all the errors without them. Also, to better my challenge, I think maybe spending more time on OTHER people's projects would also prove pretty great, as well as submitting my own work.

### Day 2: April 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
>>Worked on the personal website some more - More CSS, making the blog and category pages look a lot more decent. This includes just general format and design of the tags. Made some corrections to the URLs and what pages take you where.

>>Tested myself with what I've learned about 2 months ago -- created a new project and got a regular HTML page to display. 

**Thoughts:** Testing myself took me longer than I thought, mostly because I forgot ONE line of code... declaring the app_name and having a namespace defined in the main URL file. This will serve as the beginning of an ACTUAL raw project -- a url shortener. This is to display my progress and test my abilities of what I've learned from other projects, and work on something that I've never done before. Should be simple... right?

### Day 3: April 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked a lot on the URL Shortener I've been working on in Django. Managed to get a few things done.
	- Created a function that will randomly generate a random set of characters for the new provided URL.
	- Set up the Model and Form on the page.
	- Set up the redirection view that will take in a value (from the url) and spit out the original_link.

Tomorrow I'd like to work on the front end of it as well as possibly get deployment rolling.


**Thoughts:** I feel a little bit insecure about my development skill set. I know there is plenty to learn and I believe I'm heading in the right direction. However, I feel that I need to rely heavily on resources such as the django documentation, or notes from my Python class. It's things that are simple but they aren't memorized material. I feel like this is both a weakness and a strength. I have resources and should be able to utilize them, no?

### Day 4: April 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

URL Shortener Part 2:

- Made CSS for page. It looks pretty basic, but I don't typically challenge myself to draw up RAW CSS. I'm a big fan of Bootstrap. 

- I made a change to the gen_link function. I don't want any collisions w/ URLs.



**Thoughts:** I have intentions of deploying this app live, however, I don't think it's secured just yet.

### Day 5: April 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

- Created a search function and search bar for the blog page. Took me a lot longer to figure out than it should have.

**Thoughts:** I looked for many resources on this, and a lot of it was referring to old documents. I should be able to cover more ground tomorrow.


**Link to work:** Nope :c

### Day 6: April 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working with django authentication on personal project.

**Thoughts:** Seems pretty different from PHP authentication.


**Link to work:** Nope :c


### Day 7, 8, 9: April 17, 18, 19  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Over the last few days, I've spent some time working on basic challenges from a challenge I had saved for rainy days (like, now). The challenges were:

 - Dice Rolling - Create a function that will allow you to roll a die and obtain a random number between 1 and 6 for each prompt.

 - Guess The Number - Similar to the previous challenge, except it has the end-user guess for the number that's been generated. Based on the guess, it notifies the end-user if it's too high or low of a number.

 - Hangman - I didn't get an image affiliated with it, but it's hangman, alright.

 - Mad Libs -  Inspired by Summer Sonâ€™s Mad Libs project with Javascript, it allows me to manipulate user inputted data.



**Thoughts:** These challenges did make me think, but it wasn't SUPER challenging. I'll have to find more deeper challenges!

### Day 10: April 20,  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Spent most of today working on material design improvements to the personal website.

**Thoughts:** I'm really bad at material design.


**Link to work:** None :c


### Day 11: April 21,  2019 

**Today's Progress**:

Spent most of today working on material design improvements to the personal website, again, as well as took a shot at the authentication process for a website.

**Thoughts:** I really don't know what the standard is for building an authentication system. I think I'll just have it embedded within an app rather than being it's own..


**Link to work:** None :c
